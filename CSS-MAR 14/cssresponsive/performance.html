        <h1>Creating long term value for all stakeholders</h1>
        <p>There’s more to business than quick wins. Long-term performance takes vision. It’s about building trust and
            creating relationships that endure. That’s why we drive our business like a car: always focused on the road
            ahead.</p>

        <h1>Return on trust</h1>
        <p>Performance leads to trust. By meeting the requirements of our stakeholders, they invite us to do more. We
            build value through long-term relationships. Return on investment is important, but the key to our success
            is return on trust.</p>

        <h1>A partner you trust</h1>
        <p>Motherson does not just focus on financial results. We work hard to be of great value in the work and lives
            of all our stakeholders. When we succeed, we earn their trust and they allow us to deepen the relationship.
            Of course, we aim for high returns on our investments. But ultimately, we believe our success is best
            measured as return on trust.</p>

        <h1>Our life as a listed company since 1993
        </h1>
        <p>In 1993, we were a relatively small company focused on the Indian market. We already had great customers. But
            we realised, to reach our full potential, we had to become a listed company.</p>
