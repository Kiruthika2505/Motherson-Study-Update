        <h1>Proud to be part of your future</h1>
        <p>The industries are changing faster than they have in the last 100 years. What does this mean for us? We
            believe major trends like digitalisation, autonomous mobility and sustainability offer great opportunities
            for us.</p>

        <h1>Adapting to change</h1>
        <p>With an entrepreneurial spirit we constantly identify ways to adapt, to make our products better, and to
            better serve the needs of our customers. New solutions are executed in progressive steps and thoughtful
            ways, with focus on creating value for all stakeholders – for today and in the future.</p>

        <h1>The power to do more</h1>
        <p>Innovation means pushing the boundaries. We listen and interact with our customers and other experts to
            understand the evolving needs of the industries we serve and those industries we can potentially serve. For
            example, by participating with carmakers and technology experts in the open innovation platform of ‘Start-up
            Autobahn’ to help drive our development agenda.</p>

        <h1>Taking care of the future</h1>
        <p>For Motherson, being a trusted partner in the years to come, goes far beyond just economic objectives. With
            everything we do, we are committed to act sustainably - for the environment, for the communities we serve
            and for all our stakeholders.</p>
